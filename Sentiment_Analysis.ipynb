    "\n",
    "Well, it's exactly what it sounds like: it's building a computational system to determine the emotional tone behind words. This is important because it allows you to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions of the people in your data. At a higher level, sentiment analysis involves Natural language processing and artificial intelligence by taking the actual text element, transforming it into a format that a machine can read, and using statistics to determine the actual sentiment.\n"
